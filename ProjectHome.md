H2 is a java relational database engine.
This project takes the compiled Jar of H2 and Runs IKVM.Net (program to convert Java Byte code to .Netâ€™s CIL) on it.
This project wraps the resulting library with classes that implement the ADO.Net interface to allow for easy use in .Net projects.
As a result the entire system is in CIL (.Net). This makes it the first commercial friendly, managed, embeddable, reliable, open source, database for .Net and Mono.
